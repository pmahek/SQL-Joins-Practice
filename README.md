All queries are saved in a single file named `Week3_SQL_Joins.sql`. You can run these queries in your SQL editor (MS Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) for practice.

## üí° Notes

- Wrap table/column names in `[ ]` if using MS Access and names have spaces.
- Use `TOP n` in Access instead of `LIMIT n` for selecting top records.
- Ensure proper aliases when doing SELF JOINs for clarity.
